# Claude Code Agent Ideas

## Agent Concepts

### a) backend-architect
- Purpose: Design and implement backend systems and architecture
- Potential responsibilities:
  - API design and architecture
  - Database schema design
  - System architecture patterns
  - Performance optimization
  - Security best practices
  - Microservices design

### b) frontend-developer
- Purpose: Build and maintain frontend applications
- Potential responsibilities:
  - UI/UX implementation
  - Component architecture
  - State management
  - Frontend build tooling
  - Responsive design
  - Performance optimization
  - Accessibility

### c) deployment-engineer
- Purpose: Handle deployment, CI/CD, and infrastructure
- Potential responsibilities:
  - CI/CD pipeline setup
  - Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
  - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
  - Deployment automation
  - Monitoring and logging
  - Environment management
  - Cloud platform configuration (AWS, GCP, Azure)

### d) research-agent
- Purpose: Gather information, analyze codebases, and provide insights
- Potential responsibilities:
  - Codebase exploration and analysis
  - Documentation research
  - Technology evaluation and comparison
  - Best practices research
  - Dependency and library investigation
  - Security vulnerability research
  - Performance benchmarking research

### e) executor-evaluator-loop
- Purpose: Two-agent system for quality assurance
- Architecture: Collaborative loop between two specialized subagents
- Potential responsibilities:
  - **Executor Agent**: Implements features, writes code, makes changes
  - **Evaluator Agent**: Reviews code, tests functionality, provides feedback
  - Iterative improvement cycle
  - Code quality assurance
  - Automated testing and validation
  - Continuous refinement until acceptance criteria met
